# secondAsssignment
This repo is for the second assignment of software engineering II course. 
In addition to this i wrote the explanation of the dos attack and its different types and their implementation using different programming language such as python c and other maybe. 
So what i want to say is the code written in this repo has the corresponding dos attack type. for example; pingofdeath.py is to show the kind of attack or dos attack using ping command. Again syncFlooding.py is to show how one can attack or destroy the server using TCP's three way handshake protocol. Another one  is stateExhaustedAttack.c which is intended to  show what the attacker can do to fill the table held in firewalls, or routers with attack data and preventing the users from the accessing the network. The end one is the denialofService.py which is also one way of sending many request to the server and getting the server busy of doin our task while denying others response. This all is what i wrote in the document aswell.
