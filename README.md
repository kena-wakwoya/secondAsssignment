# secondAsssignment
This repo is for the second assignment of software engineering II course. 
In addition to this i wrote the explanation of the dos attack and its different types and their implementation using different programming language such as python, c and other maybe. 
So what i want to say is the code written in this repo has the corresponding dos attack type. for example;
1) pingofdeath.py ==> is to show the kind of attack or dos attack using ping command. 
2) syncFlooding.py ==> is to show how one can attack or destroy the server using TCP's three way handshake protocol. 
3) stateExhaustedAttack.c ==> which is intended to  show what the attacker can do to fill the table held in firewalls, or routers with attack data and preventing the users from accessing the network.
4) denialofService.py ==> which is also one way of sending many request to the server and getting the server busy of doin our task while denying other's response.This code can be run on the cmd or terminal of linux by getting into the folder where the file is saved and then write python denialofService.py <the site u want to attack> <how many request you want to sent to the server> then enter.
This all is what I wrote in the document asswell.
